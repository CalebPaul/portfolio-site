              I've been playing, writing, singing, and performing since I was 16.  I love music and love playing guitar.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm also a gear nerd;  amplifiers, effects pedals, digital or analog, etc. I can't get enough!
            </p>
            <p>
              I've worked at a couple local guitar shops over the years, and love sharing my enthusiasm for the instrument with new players.

              My family has always had a computer in our home, and I've always been attracted to innovation, gadgets, and new technology.

              Thanks to Epicodus, I'm able to accellerate my learning and really focus on code and programming for the next few months.  It's been a really great first week.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thanks to Treehouse, I was able to work on a bit of JavaScript before the August Epicodus classes started.  I'm excited to dive into JavaScript next week.

            <h4 class="page-header">A Wikipedia Clone</h4>
            <p>
              For this project I worked on cloning the wikipedia main page with my pair for the day, Jason Downing.  We had some trouble with the earlier project, which provided valuable troubleshooting experience for this one.
            </p>
            <p>
              We mostly used Bootstrap for this assignment, with HTML and CSS as well.

            <h4 class="page-header">A Brief History of Shoelaces</h4>
            <p>
              My pair (Elysia Avery Nason) and I, had fun with this project.  A historical lecture on shoelaces would indeed be uninteresting.  We found a great image for this site.
            </p>
            <p>
              We used lorem ipsum text in lieu of actually writing a lecture on shoelaces, and used CSS classes liberally.

            <p>
              Elysia and I were also paired for this project. We found great pictures of burgers from local burger chains. We used 'div' tags, and we also used custom CSS of each page (index.html and aboutme.html).
            </p>
            <p>
              After looking at those burgers while we worked, we were pretty hungry!
