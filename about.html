        <h5 class="small text-muted">(Things I used to do)</h5>
      <p>
        I've lived in Portland since 2010, and was in Eugene before that.  I've had a few different jobs, in a few different fields and industries.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most recently, I worked as part of a project management team for a local Environmental Contracting company.  We did seismic retrofits, radon testing and mitigation, and heating oil tank decommissioning and cleanup.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've also worked as a UPS courier (which has very little in common with being a UPS driver), in guitar shops, and restaurant management, the job that brought me to Portland in the first place.
      </p>
